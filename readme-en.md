## üìù About

> Watching the video above and/or accessing the project online will help you understand the explanation!

This project is the Interface (Desktop-First) of **iManager**, a business management web platform that performs the registration and management of projects, and their respective services. The projects and their categories are stored in their [API](https://github.com/Luk4x/iManager-json-server) that I developed essentially with JSON-Server.

### üìÑ Pages

The project has a total of 6 page components, which are:

  - **Home**: This is the iManager homepage, responsible for introducing the user to the site.
  - **CreateProject**: This page is responsible for creating a project.
  - **Projects**: This page is responsible for listing all the projects created by the user, and giving the possibility of creating, editing and deleting them.
  - **Project**: This page is responsible for editing the basic information of a project and creating, editing and deleting a service related to the project.
  - **Company**: This page is responsible for presenting the user with more information about iManager as a company in a deeper, more organized and thought-provoking way.
  - **Contact**: This page is responsible for presenting forms of contact between iManager and its users.

### üìë Other Components
  
Separated into **Project**, **Layout** and **Form** components, iManager has 18 more components, which are:
  
  - **Navbar**: This component is rendered in the **main** of the project, and reused on all pages. It is relative to the navigation bar present on all pages.
  - **Footer**: This component is rendered in the **main** of the project, and reused on all pages. It is related to the footer present on all pages, and in it are **my social networks**.
  - **Container**: This component consists of a dynamic container that I created to avoid code repetition.

  - **PurpleBackground**: This component is relative to the decorative purple background on almost every page.
  - **ProjectCard**: This component is related to the project cards present on the **Projects** page.
  - **ServiceCard**: Based on **ProjectCard**, this component is related to service cards present in projects.
  - **ProjectForm**: This component is related to the project creation/editing form.
  - **ServiceForm** Based on the **ProjectForm**, this component is related to the service creation/editing form.
